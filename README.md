### Introduction

This seminar is based on the framework of [FabAcademy’s ](https://fabacademy.org/)programme, a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where participants learn rapid-prototyping by planning and executing a new project each week. Here we had the chance to experiment with different prototyping techniques to pursue our own vision.

## What is Soft Robotics?
Subfield of robotics, that integrates compliant materials, soft and flexible, instead of rigid and stiff ones, into its fabrication. This difference in materiality is what allows the parts and links of robots, and by that, their functioning and purpose, to act and perform in different environments, handling things with great care, and by that, bringing them closer to human interaction.

### Vinyl Method:

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry8HMzp9p.png)

1. Design the channel you want the air to go through in the balloon and cut this out of baking paper, make sure you have an extended channel on one edge of the patter to keep an opening for the air pump later.

2. Cut out 2 pieces of vinyl bigger than the piece of baking paper you have in the overall shape you want for the balloon.

3. Sandwich the baking paper between the vinyl with the film side of the vinyl on the outside, making sure that the baking paper is in the middle of the 2 pieces with the extended channel sticking out slightly.

4. Heat press or iron the sandwich until the vinyl has completely fused apart from the pattern of the baking paper.

5. Add a straw in the extended channel of the baking paper and blow air in to inflate.

### Silicone Method:

1. Design the mould for the silicone in 2 parts, one that is just a flat version of the overall shape of the inflatable and one that is the same but with a raised path for the channel you want the air to go through which is extended to the edge of the shape to keep a channel for the air pump later.

2. Laser cut in layers and assemble or 3D print the mould.

3. Mix the silicone 1:1 parts A and B and pour into the moulds slowly pouring onto itself not onto the empty mould where possible to minimize air bubbles.

4. Leave to dry for 5 hours.

5. Glue the 2 parts of the silicone together being careful not to close off the air channels.

6. Add and air pump in the channel left open and blow air in to inflate.

## Goal: Biomaterial SoftRobotic ((╬◣﹏◢))


### *Biomaterial Recipe*
 

#### *1 option: Alginate Sodium Based*
Biopolymer: 3g Alginate Sodium 
Plasticizer: 7.5 ml Glycerine 
Additive: 1/10 ts Mica 
3g Olive oil 
Solvent: 50ml Water 
Texture: flexible 

At the same time, we tried two different recipes with Alginate Sodium, so non heat-cooking recipes. We let the material rest on two surfaces: textile and a mould.

*Comments of the result:* 
In both cases we realized how adding vegetal carbon to the mixture was turning the material drier.

#### *2 option : Amaya recipe (Gelatine based)*

240 ml water 
48g glicerine (flexi)
48g gelatine

We add a bit of spirulina pigment to give a touch of color to the sample.

*First try with Amaya's Recipe*

![IMG_6920 Large](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJijQZhYT.jpg)

We found this recipe in the documentation from a previous Fabacademy student (), which used this combination to create bio-based soft robots. We recreated it in different varieties and it proved to be exceptional for the scope. 
As we did for the Agar agar recipe, we let the material dry on different materials: an acrylic mould, a sheet of acrylic with a very thin layer of textile and on textile.

Acrylic Mould: This proved to be the most flexible and versatile, also the material didn’t shrink in the mould.

Acrylic + Textile: This was impossible to take away from the textile because of the thin thickness of the material, so it eventually remained embedded to it.

Textile: This one turn out very resistent, but not very flexible. It might me good for other applications though.




*Comments of the result:* 
- We love how the color turned out in the material and the effect it has created.
- Quite flexible 
- The sample we like the most.
- We have noticed a difference in the result of the biomaterial depending on the base on which we let it rest. We have let it rest on textile and on acrylic.


#### 3 Option : Agar Agar Based
Water 300ml 
Agar agar 10g 
Gycrerol 
- Rigid 4g 
- Normal 16g 
- elastic : 32g 

Drying: 
Working time : 5 min 
Drying Time : 7 days 
Place : dry place 

We add a bit of mica pigment to give a touch of color to the sample.

We tried to let the Agar Agar based recipe in 3 different materials: acrylic (mould), textile and a canvas. The samples dried quickly and the recipe turned out not to be elastic enough. All of them, especially the one in the mould, shrinked or got broken


*Comments of the result:* 
It breaks very easily (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ ) 
flexible but ir breaks.
We like the result of the color. 


### Soft Robotics Techniques


- ### Mould +Glicerine: 
We first tried with a mould, leaving some space on the inside to let the air inflate, and a thinner layer to close the structure. We then used gelatine and pressed the structure for 1 night to attach the two layers together.

Steps: 
 1. Glue both parts with glycerin, 
 2. clamp it, 
 3. and leave it for a few hours to ensure a good bond

Comments: Even tough the other layer was a bit too thick, and the thin one was not so flexible, we managed to inflate the soft robot. The gelatine-glue technique worked but the soft-robot still has some leaks.

- ### Heat press:

![Screenshot 2024-01-31 at 10.21.37](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1puuoDc6.png)


Steps: 
1. Cut the desired shape with the laser cutter. 
2. In the heat press, adhere the following layers in this order: a piece of biomaterial, in the middle, parchment paper with the shape, and another piece of biomaterial. At a temperature not exceeding 35 degrees, place it in the heat press to fuse and vacuum-seal the shape along with the parchment paper. 

Comments: It works better , also there are some parts where the air escapes but not as much.


- ### Laser Welding: 

![IMG_7239](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJJH6-6qa.jpg)



We saw some documentation about welding thin layers of plastic together, this could be done with soldering iron or through the light beam of the laser cutter. So we tried with different parameters to gain results but it turned out to be very quickly. This process is in fact influenced both by the machine parameters (such as speed, power, focus) and by the material features, mostly regarding its thickness.


*Comments*: After some attempts, we realized how the technique has potential but needs a lot of time and attention to find the correct equilibrium in between parameters in action. We think that maybe an appropriate research on the field could be interesting and we may try that again soon. Also, the focus parameter is probably the most important, since the width of the light beam really influenced the outcome of the eperiments.
